# ComputerArchitecture-Proj

In this project we designed a single cycle CPU that shared many of its instructions with MIPS architecture using Verilog. It was tested using a testbench of our own and the resulting waveform is attached. Simulation was done using Icarus Verilog. There is a short report explaining parts of code and results.
